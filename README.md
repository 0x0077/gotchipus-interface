# Gotchipus

Gotchipus is an innovative AI-driven dynamic NFT (dNFT) pet companion project built on Pharos Network, deeply infused with DeFi logic and on-chain soul mechanics. Imagine a world where intelligent octopus guardians—your Gotchipus—emerge from the depths of the blockchain, awakened through stablecoin staking and AI-powered evolution. By staking stable assets, you summon these sentient sea creatures, forging a soul-bond that empowers them to grow, learn, and defend the lighthouse from the creeping darkness of the Abyss Rift.


## Gotchipus Adapts. Learns. Evolves.

Gotchipus isn’t just a static NFT—it’s an intelligent, onchain entity that evolves based on interaction, environment, and custom logic.
1. **Interactive Companionship**
    - Gotchipus reacts to its emotional and physical state—updating metadata to reflect moods like hungry, happy, or tired, based on your interactions or neglect.
2. **Dynamic Evolution**
    - It monitors real-time onchain data such as staking yield or token price volatility. In response, Gotchipus dynamically updates its elemental attributes or form, reflecting its ongoing adaptation to DeFi conditions.
3. **Autonomous Intelligence**
    - With built-in Hook Modules, Gotchipus can execute onchain strategies like swapping, staking, or purchasing rare parts—all based on pre-defined logic. Think of it as your onchain pet strategist, evolving with your goals.

This isn’t just an NFT—it’s a soul-linked, living asset with memory, emotion, and purpose.

Built on Pharos Network, Gotchipus leverages ultra-low gas and high-speed performance to bring frictionless Web3 pet nurturing to life.
